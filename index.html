  <h1> Accessibility Testing </h1>
  <h2> What is the p5 widget? </h2>
  <p> This is a reusable widget made by <a href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/"> Atul Varma </a> that makes it easier to embed editable p5.js sketches in blog posts, interactive curricula, and other places.
  </p>

  <h2>Test 1 - The Navbar</h2>
  <p> The p5 widget frame contains a code editor, an ouput frame and a toolbar. In the widget below, we will take a look at the toolbar and it's contents. </p>
  <p To test, navigate to the widget frame below and enter the frame. Inside that, there is a navigation bar. Browse this. You should find a Start Button, a text output button, Grid Output Button and a Sound Output button and text saying current line.
  </p>
  <script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="400">
function setup()
{
  createCanvas(200,200);
  background(255);
}
  </script>

  <h2>Test 2 - The Play Button</h2>
  <p>
    Go ahead and press the Play button. This will run the code that you have typed. It will also create a Stop Button right next to the play button
  </p>
  <script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="400">
function setup()
{
  createCanvas(200,200);
  background(255);
}
  </script>

  <h2>Test 3 - The Coding Area</h2>
  <p>
    After the nav bar, you should find the main coding area. Type the following code and you will be able to read and execute it:
    function setup()
    {
      createCanvas(200,200);
      background(255);
    }
  </p>
  <script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="400">
function setup()
{
  createCanvas(200,200);
  background(255);
}
  </script>

  <h2>Test 4 - Changing the code</h2>
  <p>
  In the code, the line which reads - 'createCanvas(200,200)' is the line that defines the size of the output. Go ahead and change the line to 'createCanvas(400,400)'. Now when you go to the nav bar, you will notice that there are 2 new buttons now: "Undo" and "Revert". These will help with changing the code back to previous versions.
  </p>
  <script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="400">
  function setup()
  {
  createCanvas(200,200);
  background(255);
  }
  </script>

  <h2>Test 5 - Text Output</h2>
  <p>
  In the next widget, the code draws a ball on the output. Go into the nav bar, select "Text Output" and then press "Play." This will take you to the frame containing the text output. Enter the frame and go through the output. Are you able to find the description of the ball? Feel free to modify the code and press play again. Can you notice how the text output changes?
  </p>
  <script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="400">
  function setup()
  {
  createCanvas(200,200);
  background(255);
  fill("red");
  ellipse(100,100,50,50)
  }
  </script>

  <h2>Test 6 - Grid Output</h2>
  <p>
  In the next widget, the code draws a ball on the output. Go into the nav bar, select "Grid Output" and then press "Play." This will take you to the frame containing the accessible output. Enter the frame and go through the output. Are you able to find the description of the ball?
  </p>
  <script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="400">
  function setup()
  {
  createCanvas(200,200);
  background(255);
  fill("red");
  ellipse(100,100,50,50)
  }
  </script>

  <h2>Test 6 - More on Grid Output</h2>
  <p>
  In the next widget, the code  draws a moving ball on the output. Go into the nav bar, select "grid output" and then press "Play." This will take you to the frame containing the accessible output. Enter the frame and go through the output. Are you able to find the description and direction of movement of the ball?
  </p>
  <script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="400">
  function setup()
  {
    x = 0;
    createCanvas(200,200);
  }
  function draw() {
    x++;
    background(255);
    fill("red");
    ellipse(x%200,100,50,50)
  }
  </script>


  <h2>Test 7 - Sound Output</h2>
  <p>
  Please wear earphones/headphones for this test.
  In the next widget, the code draws a moving ball on the output. Go into the nav bar, select "sound output" and then press "Play." You should be able to hear the sound output. The mapping is as follows - the sounds move from left to right earphone as the object moves from left to right. The frequency reduces as the object moves from top to bottom.
  </p>
  <script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="400">
  function setup()
  {
    x = 0;
    createCanvas(200,200);
  }
  function draw() {
    x++;
    background(255);
    fill("red");
    ellipse(x%200,100,50,50)
  }
  </script>

  <h2>Test 8 - More on Sound Output</h2>
  <p>
  Please wear earphones/headphones for this test.
  In the next widget, the code  draws 2 moving balls on the output. Go into the nav bar, select "sound output" and then press "Play." You should be able to hear the sound output. The mapping is as follows - the sounds move from left to right earphone as the object moves from left to right. The frequency reduces as the object moves from top to bottom.
  </p>
  <script type="text/p5" data-preview-width="400">
  function setup()
  {
    x = 0;
    createCanvas(200,200);
  }
  function draw() {
    x++;
    background(255);
    fill("red");
    ellipse(x%200,100,50,50)
    ellipse(100,x%200,50,50)
  }
